# Examples

This section contains a collection of examples that demonstrate how to use Brightway to achieve specific objectives. This might be _"how to import a specific version of a database"_, or _"how do I plot the technosphere matrix"_. The examples are organized by topic, and are intended to be self-contained. Each example is contained in a Jupyter Notebook, which you can download and run on your own computer. It is recommended that you use the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) package manager to install the required dependencies. A [Conda environment file in YAML format](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#activating-an-environment) is provided for each example.

```{admonition} Prerequisites
:class: important
1. A working [installation of Brightway](../installation/index.md).
2. Basic knowledge of [Python data types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datatypes.html).
```

```{note}
Would you like to contribute by adding your own examples (based on your Jupyter Notebooks)?
Please follow the [Examples Contribution Guide](../contributing/examples.md).
