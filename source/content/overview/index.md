# Overview

This section gives an overview on *why* and *how* the Brightway life cycle assessment (LCA) framework works, as well as some generic LCA methodology and implementation discussion. It is not designed for people learning about Brightway for the first time - please [see the Brightway book](https://learn.brightway.dev/) which is tailored for newcomers.

```{admonition} Prerequisites
:class: important
1. A working [installation of Brightway](../installation/index.md).
2. Basic knowledge of [Python data types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datatypes.html).
```

```{note}
If you have questions that the documentation cannot answer, you can [get in touch with the Brightway community or the Brightway developers](../contact/contact.md).

## Brightway Philosophy

```{warning}
Brightway is designed for flexibility, and does not place many constraints on what you are allowed to do while using it. This can be dangerous, as we will happily allow you to delete your database or enter numerical values which can break calculations. If you are first getting started, it's safest to follow the examples and cheat sheet.
