# Brightway LCA Software Framework

## What is Brightway?
Brightway is an open-source software package for [life cycle assessment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_assessment) (LCA) written in Python. LCA is a method for evaluating the environmental impacts of a good or service. It involves analyzing all of the inputs and outputs of a the product's supply chain, including raw materials, energy use, and waste products, and quantifying the environmental impacts of these inputs and outputs over its life cycle.

Brightway is designed to make it easy to work with large datasets and perform LCA calculations quickly and accurately. It focuses on flexibility and performance, and offers many possibilities to break the limits of conventional LCA. Brightway has a strong user community in academia, and is increasingly gaining power users from industry and consulting.
